# Buggy Code:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b  # The function incorrectly returns an int instead of a str

# Prompt:
"Given the Python function above, which adds two numbers, the expected behavior is to return the result as a string, not an integer. However, the current implementation mistakenly returns an integer. Please correct the code so that it returns the sum of 'a' and 'b' as a string."
